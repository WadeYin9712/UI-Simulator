Note: Use hyperlink ("a" tag) or "button" tag if you think clicking the element could redirect you to another website. E.g., If the website is a search result page, remember to use "a" tag for each search result to allow access to it.
The "up" coordinate should always be lower than "down" coordinate, and the "left" coordinate should always be lower than "right" coordinate. Only use caption for image element, and put content inside `content_description` or `name` for text element.
The window size is: height=1080, width=1920. Please leave enough space if you think certain element needs that much. Don't create overlapping elements.
Don't miss any composed content.
