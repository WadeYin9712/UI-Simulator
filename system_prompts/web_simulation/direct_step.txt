Note: Use hyperlink or button if you think clicking an element could lead you to another website. You can use multiple JSON element for one GUI element.
The "up" coordinate should always be lower than "down" coordinate, and the "left" coordinate should always be lower than "right" coordinate.
Only use caption for image element, and put content inside `content_description` or `name` for text element.
The window size is: height=1080, width=1920.
