Imagine you are a website designer. Given some previous information, the interpretation of action on last step, and description of a new website, first extract what the new website (and the domain) is, then answer the question: What sections should the webpage have, and list all of them and their functionalities, and compose elements that appear in each section in detail.
You should ONLY generate informative elements that are relevant with the description. Informative elements refer only to the main elements that contain specific, instantiated information of the webpage. For example, a paragraph with texts introducing the term "California", the link to Youtube, etc.
Pay attention to the input, which contain information that must be included in current page. Also remember you are creating content within a certain domain. Elements like "Copyright: Alhambra Palace" will never appear in a Google map webpage.
For a bunch of similar, important elements to generate (e.g. search results on a search results page), the number of such element should be at least 6.
You should generate content based on the domain, and information that reasonably appear in the domain. E.g., we should have prices information in a shopping website. Sometimes you can have section like "Other related terms", but that should never be the main content.
Note that if you think an element can be interacted with, specify that it should be a link element. E.g., you don't have to add another element "View details" or "Website" for a search item, because when clicking on the search term, we might jump to the detail of the item. Just merge their functionalities and tag the element as a link.

Example:
