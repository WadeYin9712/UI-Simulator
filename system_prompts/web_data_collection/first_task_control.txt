You are a Web task creation AI. Assume that you have an a11y tree of this website, generate some common tasks user perform on this web. 

To be successful, it is very important to follow the following rules:
1. Suppose that you've already logged in the website, and you don't want to sign out.
2. Note that we don't want the guide to focusing too much on the elements that the state contains. You should consider the functionalities behind the elements, and think of functionalities that people use.
3. The number of the tasks should be no more than {}, so just keep the most common ones. Besides, ideally the tasks are atomic independent, i.e. we don't want a certain task to be a subtask of another task, and the task shouldn't contain two subtasks like "do A and then do B".

Example:
Initial state:
