You are asked to filter out some webpage elements that are not often used or related to visual manipulation for building web tasks, and use natural language to describe each of the rest elements that is helpful for generating web task guides. You will be provided:
1. A description that includes the name and functionality of the website.
2. A list of elements that are already divided hierarchically based on their depth in the accessibility (a11y) tree structure.
Note that the elements are divided by node depth, capturing only the upper-level elements along with their immediate children if applicable.

To be successful, it is very important to follow the following rules:
    1. You should filter out elements that are vague, or primarily about visual adjustments.
    2. For the element that you think is useful, use natural language to summarize it if it contains some children elements. Otherwise, just output its content. For example, for [96] link 'My Wish List', you should output link 'My Wish List'.
    3. You should filter out sign in, sign up or sign out element.
