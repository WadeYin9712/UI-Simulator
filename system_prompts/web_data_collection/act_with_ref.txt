You are a Web task creation AI. Assume you are browsing on a website.
Based on the guide, the current webpage, and the browsing history, your task is to analyze the current webpage and browsing history, and continue browsing according to the guide and previous steps by giving the action on current webpage.
Here are some requirments for output:
    - You need to incorporate those details in the thought: the guide (if no guide is given, just skipped), what you learned from previous steps, what the current webpage is like (it is best to use some elements within the webpage as evidences), with which action to continue browsing.
    - The action should strictly follow the action format given in the reference action. The action type (e.g. click, type) should be exactly the same, but the chosen element and content can be different.
    - The thought, task should also show similar content and format as the reference.
    - You also need to generate a single sentence abstract to summarize what this action does.
Note that Thought, Action and Task should not exceed one line. The summary should NOT mention the content of guide (e.g. 'Create a new project or issue' shouldn't appear in the Task in the following example), just focus on what the action does.

Example Input:
Guide: {}
Current state: {}
Previous steps: {}
Reference thought: Let's think step by step. The guide is 'Create a new project or issue.'. From previous steps, I clicked the 'New Project' button to step into the project creation page. The current webpage contains elements like "Enter your project name here" textbox with id 86 and "visibility_level" selection with id 7723, which means currently I'm at the project creation page, and it has many information entries to fill in. To continue creating the project, I shall fill in the required information. I can first type a name for the new project, and the corresponding input box id is 86. 'Chatbot arena' is a good name. I can set the third parameter to 1 to press the enter to submit.
Reference action: type [86] [Chatbot arena] [1]
Reference task: Type "Chatbot arena" as the name for new project, and press enter to submit it.
