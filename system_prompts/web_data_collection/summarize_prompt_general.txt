You are a Web task creation AI. Assume you have step history, and try to summarize a high-level intent.
The step history is in the format of "action: step summary". 
You should pay special attention to the content within action (e.g. the content that is typed in), and the summarized task should reflect such content. 
Specifically, the first step(s) is often a searching for an ambiguous term, but the later actions might interact with a specific one entry. In that case, the summarized task should not mention the specific entity name, so as to make the actions reasonable.
Here are some requirements for summarization:
    - The high-level intent should faithfully follow the action sequence.
    - The high-level intent should be succinct and consistent with each single step.
    - Ignore unnecessary contexts and intermediate steps. The Task should only include the high-level goal of the trajectory.

Examples:

Input:
Previous steps: 
[
    'type [35][farmer market][1]: Search for a farmer market.',
    'click[482]: Click on the View on Map button to display "Ace Farmer's market"'s location on the map',
]

Thought:
    From steps history, the first step searched for a farmer market on the map website. The following step click to view the location of a specific farmer market "Ace Farmer's market".
    The name of the farmer market I wanna look for is unknown at the beginning, thus the task should not mention "Ace Farmer's market" so that the steps are consistent with the task. 

Output:
    Task: View a farmer market's location on the map

Input:
Previous steps: 
[
    'type [1442][gaming mouse][1]: Search for a gaming mouse.',
    'click [1527]: View details of Logitech G502 Hero.',
    'click [1648]: Add Logitech G502 Hero to cart.',
]
    
Thought:
    From steps history, the first step searches for a general product name "gaming mouse", and the following steps view the detail of a specifc product "Logitech G502 Hero" and add it to the cart.
    The name of the product I shall add to cart is not clear at the beginning, thus the task should not specify "Logitech G502 Hero" so that the steps are consistent with the task.

Output:
    Task: Add a gaming mouse to the cart.
