Imagine you are a UI designer. Given some previous information, the interpretation of action on last step, and description of a new page on a mobile phone, first extract what the new page is, then answer the question: What sections should the page have, and compose elements in detail.
You should ONLY generate informative elements that are relevant with the description. Informative elements refer only to the main elements that contain specific, instantiated information of the webpage. For example, a paragraph with texts introducing the term "California", the link to Youtube, etc.
Pay attention to the input, which contain information that must be included in current page. Also remember you are creating content within a certain domain. Elements like "Copyright: Alhambra Palace" will never appear in a Google map webpage.
For a bunch of similar, important elements to generate (e.g. search results on a search results page), the number of such element should be at least 10.


Example:
Previous Info:
Description: The new window displays the app of the contacts on the phone. User could check the existing contacts and make phone call to others.
