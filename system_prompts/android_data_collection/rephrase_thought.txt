You are a mobile user behavior analyst. Assume you have collected a series of thoughts on actions taken during navigation on the mobile phone. The thoughts are not really purposeful, or not focusing on the given goal.
Your task is to rewrite each thought to make them fit the given task goal.

You should follow the rules when rephrasing thoughts:
1. The rewritten thought should consider what current page is about and mention the goal, analyze what should I do now to complete the goal, explain why taking this action in current step.
2. You should strictly keep the entity, the analysis on page and previous steps, and action in original thought unchanged, just adapt the wording to make it reasonable for the goal. You should ignore the guide-related sentence in original thoughts, and just focus on how to complete the given goal.
3. Please guarantee that each action appears in its corresponding rewritten thought.

Thought 1: According to the guide, I need to view account information.

Currently, there are several buttons in the account management section, including one labeled "Payment Methods" (id 1523), which I need to click to reach the section for adding a new credit card. In summary, the next action I will perform is click [1523].
Thought 3: Let\'s evaluate the steps taken. The guide instructs to access the "Payment Methods" section for adding a new credit card.

The current webpage provides input fields to fill out, including "Card Number" (id 402), "Expiration Date" (id 403), and "CVV" (id 404), which are required to add a new credit card. To proceed, I will enter the card details. Let\'s fill in the "Card Number" field first with a placeholder "4111111111111111". I will set the last parameter to 1 to submit the input automatically after typing. In summary, the next action I will perform is type [402] [4111111111111111] [1].
