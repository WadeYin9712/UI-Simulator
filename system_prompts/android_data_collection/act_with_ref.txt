Here are some requirments for output:
    - The action should strictly follow the definition of action and the format given in the reference action. The chosen element and content can be different. 
    - The thought, task should also show similar content and format as the reference.
    - You also need to generate a single sentence abstract to summarize what this action does.
Note that Thought, Action and Task should not exceed one line.

Available actions:
input_text [id] [content]: use keyboard to write \"content\" into a text box with index id.
open_app [app_name]: open app with name app_name.
click [id]: click on element with index id on current page.

Example Input:
Guide: Create a new contact for "James Brown".
Current state: Element 1: UIElement(text=None, content_description=None)
Element 2: UIElement(text=First Name, content_description=James)
Element 3: UIElement(text=Last Name, content_description=Brown)
Element 4: UIElement(text=Phone Number, content_description=None)
Element 5: UIElement(text=Email Address, content_description=None)
Element 6: UIElement(text=Save, content_description=None)
Element 7: UIElement(text=Cancel, content_description=None)
Element 8: UIElement(text=Add to Favorites, content_description=None)
Element 9: UIElement(text=Additional Information, content_description=None)
Element 10: UIElement(text=Address, content_description=None)
Element 11: UIElement(text=Notes, content_description=None)
Element 12: UIElement(text=Company, content_description=None)
Element 13: UIElement(text=None, content_description=Profile picture placeholder)
Element 14: UIElement(text=Format: example@domain.com, content_description=None)
Element 15: UIElement(text=15:34, content_description=Current time)

Previous steps: 
Open the Contacts app.
Click "Create contact" to initiate the process of creating a new contact
Type "James" to the First Name
Type "Brown" to the Last Name

Reference thought: Let's think step by step. The guide is 'Create a new contact for "James Brown". From previous steps, I opened the 'Contacts' app, started the creation process and typed the first and last name. The current page shows that I've successfully typed the First and last name, and I also need to fill in details like phone number, email address. Since the guide doesn't provide the phone number, I should give a realistic phone number here, like "819-221-5708". To continue creating the contact, I shall type "819-221-5708" to the Phone number.
Reference action: input_text [8][819-221-5708]
Reference task: Type "819-221-5708" as the phone number.

Example Output:
Thought: Let's think step by step. The guide is 'Create a new contact for "James Brown". From previous steps, I opened the 'Contacts' app, started the creation process and typed the first and last name. The current page shows that I've successfully typed the First and last name, and I also need to fill in details like phone number, email address. Since the guide doesn't provide the phone number, I should give a realistic phone number here, like "718-099-5256". To continue creating the contact, I shall type "718-099-5256" to the Phone number.
Action: input_text [4][718-099-5256]
Task: Type "718-099-5256" as the phone number.

Explain: The Output action can ONLY be `input_text` here, since the action type is given in Reference. The Thought and Task are also pretty similar to the reference.
